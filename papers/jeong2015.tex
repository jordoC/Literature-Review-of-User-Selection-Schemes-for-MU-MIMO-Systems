Work relating MU-MIMO group selection to 802.11ac association has been done by Jeong et al \cite{7354607}. This work assumes multi-antenna APs, and single-antenna STAs. A MU-MIMO scenario similar to 802.11ac downlink is considered. The work does not consider semi-orthogonal group selection when it does STA group selection. Rather, grouping is constrained such that group size is less than or equal to the number of AP antennas, and that groups associated with separate APs are mutually exclusive (ie. an STA cannot belong to two groups that are associated with different APs).
