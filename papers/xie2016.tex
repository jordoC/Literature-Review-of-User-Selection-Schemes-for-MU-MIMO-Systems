This work sets out to solve the association problem in a distributed fashion based on auctioning. This paper is based on the uplink rather than the downlink. The auction is based on resources determined from channel sounding. The argument in the paper is that the channel sounding is easy to do in the uplink in the AP. Although this paper is likely a good resource to consider when developing a distributed algorithm for solving the association problem, there is likely going to need to be some thought put into how the channel sounding is going to be done effectively in the downlink.
